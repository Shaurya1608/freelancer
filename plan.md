- Marketplace frontend (Phase 1): Build a professional, responsive freelancer marketplace UI with the following pages and sections: Home (hero, value proposition, benefits, featured categories/freelancers/projects, CTAs), Browse Freelancers, Browse Projects/Jobs, Service Categories, Freelancer Profile, Project/Job Detail, Pricing, Testimonials, About, FAQ, Contact, Auth (Sign in/Sign up), and Dashboards (Client and Freelancer). Include clear CTAs for posting a job, hiring, and creating a profile.

- Core user flows: 
  - Client: post projects (title, description, budget, timeline, required skills), manage posted projects, receive and review proposals, invite freelancers, shortlist/favorite, in-site messaging, hire and mark milestones complete, rate/review freelancers, notifications for activity.
  - Freelancer: browse/search projects, submit proposals (cover letter, bid, timeline, attachments), manage proposals, maintain a rich profile (bio, skills, portfolio, rates, availability, reviews), dashboard with pipeline and status, save/favorite jobs, notifications.
  - Marketplace: advanced search and filters (category, skills, budget range, experience level, availability, location), sorting, pagination, and featured listings. Define scope for payments/invoicing with you in the next step.

- Authentication and onboarding: Provide account creation and login, role selection (Client, Freelancer, Admin), email verification, password reset, session continuity, and guided onboarding to complete profiles (required fields for each role). Allow users to edit their profile and account settings, including notification preferences and privacy controls.

- Admin panel and site editability: Admin can manage users, roles, projects, proposals, reviews, and reported content; approve/feature listings; perform moderation actions. Admin can edit site content (home sections, copy, images, navigation, footer, categories, FAQs, testimonials, pricing), manage a media library, configure site-wide settings (branding, logo, colors, typography, theme), control SEO metadata for pages, publish announcements/banners, manage email templates, define feature toggles, and view an analytics overview.

- Quality and launch requirements: 
  - Responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop with consistent layout and spacing.
  - Professional aesthetics with polished micro-interactions, animations, page transitions, skeleton/loading states, and scroll-based reveals (tasteful and performant).
  - Accessibility fundamentals (keyboard navigation, focus states, readable contrast, ARIA where appropriate).
  - SEO-friendly structure (clean URLs, metadata, structured content) and legal pages (Terms, Privacy, Cookie).
  - Dark mode toggle and brandable theme. 
  - Ready for hosting on Vercel with environment-based configuration and analytics instrumentation.
